I’m talking about hype.\nOxford Dictionary describes hype as the act of “promoting or publicizing a product and exaggerating its benefits (paraphasing but you can see the source above).\nWhen it comes to AI, boy has there been hype. The sheer amount of noise surrounding AI has translated into a whole lot of funding for tons of AI startups. Just look at Hugging Face, an AI startup that’s currently valued at $4 Billion. Or Mistral, a French startup that raised the largest seed round in European history last year (2023). Despite being 4 weeks old.\nOr even CharacterAI, a $1 Billion startup that creates…. AI digital characters for you to talk to? What the-\nSo this begs the question, is the hype valid and is the technology truly revolutionary? Or is this just another carriage at the end of the extremely long hype train?\nThe Tech Behind all the buzzwords, at it’s core Artificial itelligence is really just a bunch of math. A lot of math. Most AI tools and services have a Large Language Model (or LLM) at their core. While this may sound like some magical tech thing, in reality it’s really just super fancy autocomplete. An AI takes in a prompt from a user and looks through its dataset to find the words that are most likely to come next.\nFor example, a dataset could have an explanation of dark clouds:\n...grey clouds usually mean rainfall is expected... Should a user ask a question such as: \"Why are the clouds grey?\" . the LLM looks through it’s dataset to find the most likely sentence to match this and “autocompletes” the answer to the question.\nThe clouds are grey because...rainfall is expected\nPretty neat right? Well this is the basis behind EVERY SINGLE ONE of the hundreds of booming AI start-ups, and all this isnt without its’ faults either. LLMs can also suffer from a phenomenon known as “hallucinations”. This sounds complicated but in reality it’s just a case of the LLM being unable to predict the next word as nothing exists in it’s dataset that could complete it’s answer.\nAt the end of the day that’s the main limitation of AI. It simply cannot create new information.\nThe Hype So why all the hype? Well, AI is a very powerful tool. It can be used to automate a lot of boring tasks that would otherwise be done by humans. It can also be used to create exciting stuff that would be impossible without it.\nThis is all great, but the hype comes from the fact that AI is not a magic bullet. It’s not going to solve all of our problems. It’s not going to make us all rich. It’s not going to make us all happy. It’s just a tool.\nNothing more, nothing less.\nBut if there’s one thing startups are good at, it’s hyping up their products. And AI is no exception. It’s simply the latest buzzword that’s being used to sell rebranded versions of existing technology. Founders know this, and they’re taking full advantage of it.\nThe Future or just a bubble? Tech history is full of buzzwords that burst as bubbles, and AI could go the same way or prove us wrong.\nOne thing is for sure though, AI is here to stay. And as long as there is a trend, there will be hype. And where there is hype, there will be startups.\nWho knows? Maybe in a few years we’ll all be bowing to our AI overlords. Or maybe we’ll be laughing at how silly we were to think that Devin was going to center our divs for us.\nOnly time will tell.\nBut for now, let’s just enjoy the ride.\n","wordCount":"710","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/posts/artificial-intelligence/https:/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https:/substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3010177d-a7b0-4013-9dfe-cacd3aa64592_600x360.jpeg","datePublished":"2024-04-29T20:45:45+02:00","dateModified":"2024-04-29T20:45:45+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Abdul Baari Davids"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/artificial-intelligence/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Abdul Baari Davids","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="  (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35></a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
