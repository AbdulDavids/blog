# Startup Ideas

A bunch of (mostly bad) startup ideas.

1. **QueueMaster**: A subscription service that hires professional line-stander to wait in queues on behalf of customers, because waiting in line is just too inconvenient for the busy elite.

2. **Car Proximity Chat**: A video game style proxmity chat for cars, with push to talk on the steering wheel. Great for expressing road rage when you get cut off by a taxi.

3. **Curry Gari**: A food delivery service that delivers only curry and rice. The catch? You have to eat it with your hands. __*Curry Gari*__ is a play on the Indian word for car, *gari*.

4.
