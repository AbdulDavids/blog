# Startup Ideas

A bunch of (mostly bad) startup ideas.

1. **QueueMaster**: A subscription service that hires professional line-stander to wait in queues on behalf of customers, because waiting in line is just too inconvenient for the busy elite.

<br>

2. **Car Proximity Chat**: A video game style proxmity chat for cars, with push to talk on the steering wheel. Great for expressing road rage when you get cut off by a taxi.

<br>

3. **Curry Gari**: A food delivery service that delivers only curry and rice. The catch? You have to eat it with your hands. __*Curry Gari*__ is a play on the Indian word for car, *gari*.

<br>


4. **SamosaAsAService**:  A website to let you design and order samosas with different fillings and have them delivered to your door. SaaS - Samosas as a Service.

<br>

5. **Self-driving taxi (but for SA)**: It's easier to do than self-driving cars because they can't get any less safe than current taxis. The trolley problem is also solved in that you select the most damaging route and take that one.

<br>

6. **Starbucksifier**: A JS library where you type in your name and it returns your name, but incorrect. Herman -> Hermit or Bradley -> Bradey. Anyone want to fund me?

<br>

7. **Auto-Incorrect**: The same thing as above but a tool that runs through your code and misspells all your variables slightly.

<br>

8. **The Cadre Games**: The Hunger Games except with government officials found guilty of corruption as a reality TV show.
