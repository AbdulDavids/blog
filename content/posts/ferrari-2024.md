> "We are checking"


### Pre Season

1. Promo video with a slow pitstop

2. "Box box .... no stay out" for Carlos minutes into running.


### Bahrain 

1. No fresh tires for Leclerc in Q3

2. Extremely dangerous brake failure for Leclerc for the entire race 

3. Carlos' overheating +  "We are checking" 


### Jeddah

1. Sainz catches appendicitis 

2. Leclerc has bad pitstop and loses P2 as a result

### Australia 

1. We are checking (Actually a pretty good race, Ferrari 1-2)

### Suzuka 

1. Leclerc has terrible setup in Qualifying. Still has an amazing run from P8 to P3 with a one stop. Absolute masterclass despite the team's best efforts to sabotage him.

2. Leclerc forced to give up P3 for Sainz for seemingly no reason.

### China

1. Ferrari 1v1 during sprint and race, almost bottled it.

### Miami

1. Sainz turned into a terrorist (ruined Piastris race)

2. Usual Leclerc bottlings

### Emilia Romagna (officially known as the Formula 1 MSC Cruises Gran Premio del Made in Italy e dell'Emilia-Romagna 2024)

1. Not a bad race, usual ferrari shenanigans during quali (looking promising through Q1 and Q2 but bottling it in Q3).
