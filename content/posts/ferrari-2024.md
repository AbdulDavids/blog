> "We are checking"


### Pre Season

1. Promo video with a slow pitstop

2. "Box box .... no stay out" for Carlos minutes into running.


### Bahrain 

1. No fresh tires for Leclerc in Q3

2. Extremely dangerous brake failure for Leclerc for the entire race 

3. Carlos' overheating +  "We are checking" 


### Jeddah

1. Sainz catches appendicitis 

2. Leclerc has bad pitstop and loses P2 as a result

### Australia 

1. We are checking (Actually a pretty good race, Ferrari 1-2)

### Suzuka 

1. Leclerc has terrible setup in Qualifying. Still has an amazing run from P8 to P3 with a one stop. Absolute masterclass despite the team's best efforts to sabotage him.

2. Leclerc forced to give up P3 for Sainz for seemingly no reason.

### China

1. Ferrari 1v1 during sprint and race, almost bottled it.

### Miami

1. Sainz turned into a terrorist (ruined Piastris race)

2. Usual Leclerc bottlings

### Emilia Romagna 

(officially known as the Formula 1 MSC Cruises Gran Premio del Made in Italy e dell'Emilia-Romagna 2024)

1. Not a bad race, usual ferrari shenanigans during quali (looking promising through Q1 and Q2 but bottling it in Q3).

### Monaco

1. No words, absolute masterclass from Charles Marc Herve Percerval Leclerc

2. Sainz had puncture on lap 1 but otherwise a strategic masterclass from Ferrari (ignore the fact there were zero pitstops).

3. ["We are not interested"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcA60raRB54&ab_channel=Javalinsta)


### Canada

Breaking the Monaco Curse came at a cost, in Canada Ferrari had an absolute Disasterclassâ„¢.

1. Leclerc "Box Box shananigans came back, with Ferrari bringing him in for Inters while the track was still dry, throwing him to the back of the grid, getting lapped by even the Haas cars.

2. Ferrari then brought him in a second time to "reboot" the car due to expected engine issues. The issues were resolved, however Charles was now two entire laps behind the front of the pack. Eventually Leclerc decided to retire the car.

3. Sainz span into his future teammate Albono. 

### Spain

1. Uneventful race.

### Austria

1. Leclerc suffers wing damage on lap 1, has to pit and is now last. 

2. Ferrari's upgrades somehow send them backwards in performance.

### British

1. 

### Hungary

1. Largely uneventful for Ferrari as the car is a shitbox, but Leclerc still manages to get P4.

2. Mclaren drama was elite however.

### Belgium

1. Leclerc gets the worst upgrade package in the history of F1, and has the lowest top speed through Eau Rouge. This loses him P1 on lap 3.
