# About Me
&nbsp;

I was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa and Iâ€™m a software engineer currently studying towards my BSc in Computer Science. I'm passionate about learning new things and trying out stuff that almost certainly wont work (which you'll find a lot of on this blog).
&nbsp;

 I'm particularly interested in LLMs as well as cloud computing and my long term dream is to create a real life [JARVIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) from Iron Man, which happens to be the movie that inspired me to pursue software engineering

&nbsp;

I've been working in the industry since I was 18, during my final year of Matric I worked as a freelancer on an ecommerce site. I've also started my own web development startup called [Cascade](https://www.instagram.com/cascadeweb/) which I have developed along with some friends from high school. 

I've also worked as a Software Engineer intern for [CodeInfinity](https://codeinfinity.co.za/). During my time there I learnt tons of new skills and recieved mentorship from senior engineers.

&nbsp;

In my spare time I like to pursue silly projects and bad startup ideas. On weekends you'll find me crying, screaming and throwing up as Ferrari loses another chance at a championship. Next year will be our year though hahaðŸ˜…

### About this Blog


This blog is designed to be an outlet for random thoughts and rants I'll be sharing with the 2-3 people who'll actually stumble upon it (If you're a recruiter, this isnt how I am in real life I swear). I update my blog as much as my free time will alow me, and I treat my blogs as a candid place to express ideas. Basically just a brain dump of what I'm thinking at the time, and occasionally I'll write a high effort post.



&nbsp;

All opinions expressed are my own, and no one elses (including, but especially my employer). If I have anything new going on I'll probably put it in the home page (like a new blog post).
