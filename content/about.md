# Hi, I'm Abdul Baari!
&nbsp;


Iâ€™m a software engineer currently studying towards my BSc in Computer Science. I'm passionate about learning new things and trying out stuff that almost certainly wont work (which you'll find a lot of on this blog).

 I'm particularly interested in LLMs as well as cloud computing and my long term dream is to create a real life [JARVIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.)from Iron Man, which happens to be the movie that inspired me to pursue software engineering

&nbsp;

In my spare time I like to look longingly at cool old German cars and follow Formula One. On weekends you'll find me crying, screaming and throwing up as Ferrari loses another chance at a championship. Next year will be our year though hahaðŸ˜…

&nbsp;

This blog is designed to be an outlet for random thoughts and rants I'll be sharing with the 2-3 people who'll actually stumble upon it (If you're a recruiter, this isnt how I am in real life I swear). 

&nbsp;

Anyways, enjoy the show!
