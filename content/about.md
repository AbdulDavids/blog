# Hello there!
&nbsp;


My name is Abdul Baari and Iâ€™m a software engineer currently studying towards my BSc in Computer Science. I'm passionate about new technologies, especially artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing (AWS pricing scares me). 

In my spare time I like to write as well as well as look at cool old German cars. On weekends you'll find me crying, throwing and screaming as Ferrari loses another chance at a championship. 

This blog is designed to be an outlet for random thoughts and rants I'll most certainly be sharing with the 2-3 people who'll actually stumble upon it (If you're a recruiter, this isnt how I am in real life I swear). Anyways, enjoy the show!
